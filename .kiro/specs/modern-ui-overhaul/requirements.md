# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing Billion Dollar Idea Platform into a modern, sleek application with a shadcn-inspired design system featuring white backgrounds, black borders, and minimal color usage.

5. IF no project name is provided THEN the system SHALL generate one based on the idea content

### Requirement 6
