# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Billion Dollar Idea Platform is an open-source AI-powered system that transforms a single text-based business idea into a complete business venture through autonomous agent orchestration. The platform uses specialized AI agents to execute a 6-stage pipeline covering everything from idea validation to deployment and optimization, leveraging Ollama's gpt-oss:20b model for AI capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Creation and Management

**User Story:** As an entrepreneur, I want to input my raw business idea and have the system create a structured project, so that I can track the development of my venture through all stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a business idea via POST /api/projects THEN the system SHALL create a new project with a unique ID, structured name, and the original idea text
2. WHEN a user requests GET /api/projects THEN the system SHALL return all projects with their basic information
3. WHEN a user requests GET /api/projects/:id THEN the system SHALL return the complete project details including all tasks and artifacts
4. WHEN a user requests DELETE /api/projects/:id THEN the system SHALL remove the project and all associated data
5. IF a project creation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with status codes

### Requirement 2: Six-Stage Agent Orchestration Pipeline

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically execute a comprehensive 6-stage business development pipeline using specialized AI agents, so that my idea is transformed into a complete business plan with technical implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new project is created THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate the 6-stage pipeline starting with Stage 1
2. WHEN Stage 1 (Input Processing) executes THEN the Idea Structuring Agent SHALL convert the raw idea into a formal project description
3. WHEN Stage 2 (Validation & Strategy) executes THEN the Market Research Agent and Technical Architecture Agent SHALL analyze market viability and propose technical architecture
4. WHEN Stage 3 (Development) executes THEN the UI/UX Design, Frontend Development, Backend Development, Database Design, and QA Agents SHALL generate comprehensive development artifacts
5. WHEN Stage 4 (Go-to-Market) executes THEN the Business Formation, Marketing Content, and Sales Funnel Agents SHALL create business and marketing strategies
6. WHEN Stage 5 (Operations) executes THEN the Customer Support, Analytics, and Financial Management Agents SHALL establish operational frameworks
7. WHEN Stage 6 (Self-Improvement) executes THEN the Continuous Monitoring and Optimization Agents SHALL propose improvement strategies
8. WHEN each stage completes THEN the system SHALL automatically proceed to the next stage
9. IF any agent fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining agents in the stage

### Requirement 3: Real-time Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time updates of the agent orchestration progress, so that I can monitor the development of my business venture as it happens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client connects via WebSocket THEN the system SHALL establish a persistent connection for real-time updates
2. WHEN a new project starts THEN the system SHALL broadcast a 'project:start' event to connected clients
3. WHEN any task status changes THEN the system SHALL broadcast a 'task:update' event with the current status
4. WHEN a new artifact is created THEN the system SHALL broadcast an 'artifact:create' event with artifact details
5. WHEN a project completes all stages THEN the system SHALL broadcast a 'project:complete' event
6. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL broadcast an 'error' event with error details
7. IF a WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully

### Requirement 4: AI Integration and Content Generation

**User Story:** As the system, I want to integrate with Ollama's gpt-oss:20b model to generate high-quality content for each agent's tasks, so that the business venture artifacts are comprehensive and actionable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any agent needs to generate content THEN the system SHALL use the Ollama service to communicate with the gpt-oss:20b model
2. WHEN the Ollama service receives a prompt THEN it SHALL return generated text content appropriate for the agent's task
3. WHEN Ollama API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL store it as an artifact with appropriate type classification
5. IF the Ollama service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them when service is restored

### Requirement 5: Data Persistence and Management

**User Story:** As the system, I want to persist all project data, tasks, artifacts, and agent information in a reliable database, so that user progress is never lost and can be retrieved at any time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to the SQLite database using Prisma ORM
2. WHEN a project is created THEN the system SHALL persist the project data with user association
3. WHEN tasks are created or updated THEN the system SHALL persist task status, stage, and agent information
4. WHEN artifacts are generated THEN the system SHALL persist the content with type classification and project association
5. WHEN agent definitions are needed THEN the system SHALL retrieve agent information from the database
6. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement transaction rollback and error recovery

### Requirement 6: Agent Management and Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage and configure the available AI agents, so that the platform can be extended with new capabilities and agents can be updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load all available agents from the database
2. WHEN GET /api/agents is requested THEN the system SHALL return a list of all available agents with their descriptions and stages
3. WHEN agents are executed THEN the system SHALL track which agent is responsible for each task
4. WHEN new agents are added THEN the system SHALL be able to incorporate them into the appropriate pipeline stages
5. IF an agent configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL log the error and skip that agent

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and System Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and continue processing where possible, so that temporary failures don't derail my entire business venture development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and transaction management
3. WHEN Ollama API calls fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to a maximum number of attempts
4. WHEN WebSocket connections fail THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection and state synchronization
5. WHEN agent execution fails THEN the system SHALL log the error, mark the task as failed, and continue with other agents
6. IF critical system components fail THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and provide meaningful error feedback

### Requirement 8: Development and Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage and development tools, so that the platform is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are run THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage for services and controllers
2. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL validate API endpoints and agent orchestration pipeline
3. WHEN the development server starts THEN it SHALL provide hot reloading and detailed logging
4. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN Prisma SHALL handle schema changes safely
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and stack traces for debugging
